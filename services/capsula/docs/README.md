You need to have installed these libraries:

- mkdocs
- mkdocstrings
- mkdocstrings-python
- mkdocs-material
- Pygments

Then, you just have to execute this commands:

``
mkdocs build
``

and

``
mkdocs serve
``

Make sure your docstrings are correct according to pydocstyle and Google docstring standard.
You can change this configuration in Pycharm (in File > Settings > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Docstrings >
Docstring Format should be Google).
